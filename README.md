# Client library for Azure ServiceBus for .Net Core

A client library to post and receive strongly types messages from Azure's ServiceBus. It uses the REST api as communication with Azure, so every interaction will open a new tcp connection.

It's written in F# and I made it to explore F# and .Net Core. I intend to create a nice interface for C# code as well.
